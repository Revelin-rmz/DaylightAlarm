# DaylightAlarm

Alarm System Integration Project

## Devices:

stepper motor
photosensor
infra red sensor
buzzer

## Objective:

When the light sensor detects an a specific light level it activates the curtain and buzzer functions.
If not already opened, a stepper is instructed to draw open a curtain to let the light in while a buzzer begins to beep.
If the user hovers or places their hand above the alarm, it is interpreted as a shutoff signal to the buzzer.
